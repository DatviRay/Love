            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p>
                In the heart of a city where the winters were warm,<br>
                We met in the alleys of a love that can't be torn.<br>
                Under the golden hue of the setting sun,<br>
                Our hearts beat as one, the way it had just begun.<br><br>

                I remember the first time our lips met,<br>
                In a world that seemed to pause and forget.<br>
                We went on outings, hand in hand, side by side,<br>
                Every moment with you was where I truly belonged.<br><br>

                My love for you, it never fades,<br>
                Across the miles, it only grows, unafraid.<br>
                I'll stand by your side, forevermore,<br>
                In my heart, you’ll always be my shore.<br><br>

                You cared for me in ways no one else could,<br>
                In your eyes, I found the strength I needed, oh so good.<br>
                Two years ago, I boarded a plane,<br>
                To a land of snow, where the cold reigns.<br><br>

                But even thousands of miles apart,<br>
                Our love remains, a burning heart.<br>
                Every night, I dream of your embrace,<br>
                A love so deep, it’s engraved on my face.<br><br>

                My love for you, it never fades,<br>
                Across the miles, it only grows, unafraid.<br>
                I'll stand by your side, forevermore,<br>
                In my heart, you’ll always be my shore.<br><br>

                Distance hurts, it aches so true,<br>
                But it’s in the silence where our love grew.<br>
                Through every trial, through every test,<br>
                Our bond, unbroken, stands the best.<br><br>

                I’ll fight for us, I won’t let go,<br>
                For a future where our hearts will flow.<br>
                Together we’ll face the storms of time,<br>
                With a love that’s pure, and divine.<br><br>

                My love for you, it never fades,<br>
                Across the miles, it only grows, unafraid.<br>
                I'll stand by your side, forevermore,<br>
                In my heart, you’ll always be my shore.<br><br>

                When the winter was warm and filled with love,<br>
                We promised each other, from above.<br>
                That no matter how far, no matter the pain,<br>
                We’d find our way back, again and again.<br><br>

                I close my eyes, and I see you there,<br>
                In the sunlight, in the gentle air.<br>
                Our love is a flame, a guiding light,<br>
                Leading me to you, every single night.<br><br>

                So hold on tight, my dearest one,<br>
                Our journey’s long, but we’ve just begun.<br>
                In a world that’s vast, and sometimes cold,<br>
                Our love will keep us, forever golden.<br>
            </p>
